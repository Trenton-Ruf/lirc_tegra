This code is a further development of the Lirc driver for the
Raspberry Pi by Aron Szabo http://aron.ws/projects/lirc_rpi/, which
was derived from the Lirc serial driver.

The added features are: Multiple transmitter support, support for
"modulation frequency 0", and the programmable inversion of outputs.

It is described in greater detail in
http://harctoolbox.org/lirc_rpi.html. Please also see
http://harctoolbox.org/rpi_daughterboard.html, describing possible hardware.
